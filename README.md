DescribeJunit
=============

# Background
Another way to write Junit, Inpired by Mocha.js. I always feel that the fact we need to use camelCase or snake_case to define
our test name is a bit too much. Sometimes it becomes hard to read, specially if we want to use some specific char that Java
forbid to use it as a method name (ex. '+'). 

Has been working on Javascript and NodeJS recently, I've enjoyed very much the way of Mocha.js (http://mochajs.org/) define a test.
It start with describe and continue with it. So why Java cannot have this ? Java 8 has lambda expression, can we use it in our test ?
